/**
 * Stamp canonical media identity onto historical sessions in one bounded batch.
 *
 * Three passes, each windowed the same way (ORDER BY started_at DESC LIMIT):
 * - Fresh stamp: joins sessions to library_items on (server_id, rating_key) and
 *   fills the resolved media id and show id. Nothing else on a row is written:
 *   history keeps its own provider ids, keys and titles. Sessions whose rating
 *   key has no non-container library item pointing at a non-container media row
 *   are excluded so they never re-select; an imported row also needs the item to
 *   carry its title (sameTitleForImport), since its key may have been reused.
 * - Show-link repair: sessions that already have media_id but were stamped before
 *   their media row's show_media_id existed (e.g. the show synced later). Re-running
 *   this is safe - a repaired session no longer matches either pass's WHERE clause.
 * - Container unlink: sessions linked to a show, season, artist or album media row
 *   lose their media and provider ids. The fresh stamp refuses container items, so
 *   an unlinked session is never stamped back onto one.
 * - Imported plays still without identity after the key passes resolve through
 *   the media resolver by title, year and episode numbers (importedPlayIdentity.ts),
 *   as a fresh import does at insert. A tracked play takes this path only when its
 *   rating key is confirmed gone from the server (fullScanFloors): otherwise what is
 *   playing exists there, its key is exact and the sync of the item stamps it.
 *   A row the fresh stamp could still take by key is left to it,
 *   so a batch limit never sends a keyed row down the title path. Every row the
 *   pass reads is handled, linked or not, so its bound moves past rows that
 *   cannot resolve instead of re-reading them.
 *
 * The optional started_at window is what keeps this survivable on a compressed
 * hypertable: one transaction per chunk bounds tuple decompression to a single
 * chunk's segments. The per-transaction cap is lifted inside that bound - a
 * busy month-chunk decompresses more tuples than the 100k default even for a
 * 10k-row batch, and tripping the cap turns the walk into a fail-retry loop.
 * The window is the memory guard, not the cap; an unwindowed batch with the
 * cap disabled globally is what once ballooned until the OOM killer took
 * postgres down.
 *
 * `bounds` is the cursor the previous batch of the same window returned. Each
 * pass picks its newest rows first, so a pass that filled its limit has
 * written every match newer than its oldest row, and one that came back short
 * has written every match below its bound. A written row stops matching its
 * own pass, which is why the bound can be inclusive without an id tiebreak:
 * only unwritten ties come back. The passes feed each other, though. A fresh
 * stamp can create repair work in the same batch, and an unlink can create
 * fresh work for the next one, so a pass's next bound also covers the rows the
 * pass feeding it wrote or will write.
